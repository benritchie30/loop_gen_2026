PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md describes the structure and function of my project. Use this as context as you work on the project. As you come to understand the project better add new features or realize something should be different in the overview make updates and additions to the overview. Add relavent notes to the overview if they are important to remember. I want this file concise and acurate so don't add irrelizant points that wouldn't fit the project overview
